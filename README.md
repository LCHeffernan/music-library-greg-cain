# Music Library

A project created as part of my studies with [Command Shift](https://www.commandshift.co/). In this project I'll be learning about database design, SQL, postgres and CRUD Operations.

## Roadmap

- follow track

  \*note that there may be a delay as I'll be moving house during this project ðŸ™ƒ

## Installation and how to use

As it's very early on in development there is nothing to install or use! But I'll be sure to update here once that changes!

## Application dependencies

## Support

Thank you to all the support from tutors and fellow coursemates at Command Shift ðŸ™Œ
