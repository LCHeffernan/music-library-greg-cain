# Music Library

A project created as part of my studies with [Command Shift](https://www.commandshift.co/). In this project I'll be learning about database design, SQL, postgres and CRUD Operations.

## Roadmap

- follow track

  \*note that there may be a delay as I'll be moving house during this project ðŸ™ƒ

## Installation and how to use

1. Install docker onto your machine
2. In your terminal `<remove and change before entering>`

   ```cli
   docker run --name postgres -p <portNumber>:<portNumber> -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=<yourPassword> -d postgres
   ```

   This pulls and runs a postgres image needed to create a database. You'll also need to create .env and .env.test to load in environment variables for the database.

   ```
   PGUSER=<user>
   PGHOST=localhost
   PGPASSWORD=<yourPassword>
   PGDATABASE=<nameOfDatabase>
   PGPORT=<pg portNumber>
   PORT=<port>
   ```

3. cd into the repo locally on your machine and initialise it with:

   ```
   npm init
   ```

4. Start the API with:

   ```
   npm start
   ```

5. In your browser type:

   ```
   localhost:<port you set in .env>/swagger/
   ```

6. You should now be able to see a breakdown of all the routes and be able to interact with the API!
